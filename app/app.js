As a result, the technology functions by enhancing one\u2019s current perception of reality. By contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one. Augmentation is conventionally in real-time and in semantic context with environmental elements, such as sports scores on TV during a match. With the help of advanced AR technology (e.g. adding computer vision and object recognition) the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes interactive and digitally manipulable.

This workshop will explore the various means that an intruder has available to gain access to computer resources. It will investigate weaknesses by discussing the theoretical background behind, and whenever possible, actually performing the attacks.","priority":"0"},{"id":"76","workshop":"Ethical Hacking","title":"Workshop Content","desc":"<b>Module 1:<\/b> Introduction to Ethical Hacking- provide a slight view about the syllabus to be covered in the workshop.\r\n\r\n<b>Module 2:<\/b> Website Attacks- Types of attacks will be explained on the websites and how they are hacked (Live demonstration will be provided).\r\n\r\n<b>Module 3:<\/b>: Web Server Attacks- Knowledge about web servers and attacks on them, Tracing a Website, Complete info about a website and tracing the attacker\u2019s gateway(Live demonstrations will be provided).\r\n\r\n<b>Module 4:<\/b> Facebook Attacks- Various attacks on facebook profiles will be explained and how can you hack into a facebook account as well as safety tips (Live demonstration will be provided).\r\n\r\n<b>Module 5:<\/b> E-Mail Attacks- Various attacks on e-mail accounts will be explained and how can you hack into an e-mail account as well as the safety tips (Live demonstration will be provided).\r\n\r\n<b>Module 6:<\/b> Cloud Computing- A detailed introduction about cloud computing (Live demonstration will be provided).\r\n\r\n<b>Module 7:<\/b> System Hacking- Various possible attacks on a computer system will be shown about how the system can be hacked.
